These files are svgs, which means they are interactive plots. You are able to get info on certain datapoints, as well as hide and unhide certain time series in the larger plot.

In order to get info on a datapoint, hover over the point and a tooltip will appear explaining the point

In order to hide a certain line, uncheck the label associated with it on the sides of the plot

This interactive nature isnâ€™t available through GitHub rendering, so you must view these files locally for the full functionality.
